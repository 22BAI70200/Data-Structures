# CPPStructs

CPPStructs is a repository containing a collection of C++ header files for various commonly used data structures. Whether you're working on a C++ project or looking to learn and implement data structures like linked lists, queues, trees, and more, this repository provides a well-documented set of headers that you can easily include in your code.

## Why C++

Because we love it!

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CPPStructs.git
```
or simply download the required .hpp file for the data structure you need and copy it in your project folder.

## Available Data Structures

Currently, this repository includes the following data structures:

- Stack
- Linked List
  
We're continuously adding more data structures, so stay tuned for updates!

## Usage

You can include the desired data structure header file in your C++ project like this:

```cpp
#include "include/filename.hpp"

// Your code here
```

**Don't forget to check the documentation in each header file for usage examples and detailed explanations.**
